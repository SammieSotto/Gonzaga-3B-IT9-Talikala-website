            <hr>
            <p><h5 align = "right">Talikala's problem is financial stability and the stress the comes with it. Financial stability is a property of a financial system that dissipates financial imbalances that arise endogenously in the financial markets or as a result of significant adverse and unforeseeable circumstances. It basically means where they get money from is not that stable. Without financial stability, they wont be able to help more people and most likely drown in debt. With this problem in their minds each and everyday, they will continue to struggle with dealing with the stress of it. </h5></p>

            <hr>
            <p><h5 align = "right"> With the help of our project proposal, we'd be able to give 75% of our funds to them as donations, 75% of our income would also be divided into three groups making it 25% for each division, the first division is for the institution itself, we would be spending 25% of our income to buy talikala their needs for their own t-shirts and their crochet bags, the other 25% of our income is for the schooling of the younger generation who suffered from prostitution, the last 25% would be for the community which talikala is currently leading/helping. </h5></p>

            <hr>
            <p><h5 align = "right"> Among the ways we can assist them is by supporting their mission and the work they are expected to carry out for their institution. However, our group feels that while it is important to raise awareness of them and the work they are doing, we should also be actively involved in providing them with financial support, at least a small amount of assistance, and support for their mission in order to attract additional support from those outside the school or the institution. </h5></p>

            <hr>
            <p><h5 align = "right">Instead of simply just sharing their advocacy online, we’re here to provide them the beneficiaries of our project proposal. We are able to help them fullfill their mission in helping prostituted women have a better future. With our project proposal, we’d be able to donate what we earn and further on help them with their financial stability.</h5></p>

            <b><h4 align = "center"> <a>D</a>evelop And Implement A Plan Of Action </h4></b>
            <hr>
            <p><h5 align = "right"> But out of all these plans, what we think is the best is to hold a fundraiser since it is simple to do. We also came up with the idea to create an online business selling old or used clothes and thrifted items. We call it “Thriftma”. Thriftma will help them since 75% of our income from it will be given to Talikala as donations. By doing so, we can enjoy the fun of selling stuff online and at the same time, help others in need. We plan on executing this business idea of ours in a way that all of us may contribute and at the same time, help each other and our partner institution. With the money that would be left with us after we donated, we plan to save it and put it to good use like to thrift more items to be sold and earn more money so we could donate and help more. </h5></p>
