          <a>EFFECTS OF EGGSHELLS AND BANANA PEELS ON VIGNA RADIATA (MUNG BEAN) PLANT HEIGHT</a>
<br></br>
          <a>INTRODUCTION</a>
<br></br>
  <h1>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</h1>
    <p>A third of the food produced worldwide, or nearly 1.3 billion tons annually, is lost to garbage. While there is no method to recover this food, 
    there are various ways to utilize food waste. Compost is an organic material that may be put to soil to help plants develop, and food waste can be used to make it. In other words, it can be utilized as a substitute for 
    synthetic fertilizer. Composting is one of the variables that can contribute to the reduction of the 1.3 billion tons of food that are wasted each year. Our ultimate success would be to eliminate or at least 
    completely eradicate food waste from the planet, but lowering it would still be better. Through our project, we hope to find out whether food composting actually benefits plants and whether there is a use for all the food scraps 
    that are thrown away on a daily basis. While for the institution we have collaborated with, I think that this can benefit them because it is a simpler, more affordable, and easier to obtain alternative to commercial fertilizer, and it can genuinely benefit the plants they wish to cultivate and eat.</p>
<br></br>

  <h1>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</h1>
    <p>Does the amount of the eggshells and banana peels (fertilizer) affect the height of the vigna radiata (mung bean)? </p>
<br></br>

  <h1>HYPOTHESIS</h1>
  <p>If 28.3 grams (2 tablespoons) crushed eggshells are given to the vigna radiata (mung bean), then it will grow taller.</p>
<br></br>

 <td>The eggshells are first given a thorough water rinse before being crushed into a fine powder. After that is finished, place the crushed eggshells in the soil and scatter it evenly so that the plants can get the calcium that the eggshells provide. Same process with the banana peels but instead of crushing, we would cut them.</td>

  <td bgcolor="#007500">Dosage and Frequency of Compost Application to the Test Plants </td>
  <td>The dosage and frequency of the test plants would be the same, which would be 3 inches for a normal plant and an average gardener. The only thing that will be different is the type of fertilizer that will be used, or no fertilizer will be used.

 <tr>
  <td bgcolor="#007500">Making observations and/or measurements about the Test Plant</td>
  <td>By the end, the use of eggshells were most successful when compared to using banana peels or no fertilizers at all. It grew the largest out of the three. These plants should be observed/measured in the morning, since this is also the time you should be watering them. We should observe them by height through the use of a ruler, and also how fast they grew.
