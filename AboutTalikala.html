            Talikala's goal is to improve both the lives of former prostitutes and their survivors. Its objectives include raising sex workers' chances of financial independence, promoting gender equality in society, <br>
            enhancing their reproductive health, and creating and offering sex workers' support systems. In order to address the issue of prostitutes and their survivors, Talikala Inc. was founded on August 7, 1987. <br>
            Raising awareness of issues relating to women's and children's rights, reproductive health, gender sensitivity, anti-prostitution, anti-human trafficking, <br> 
            online sexual abuse and exploitation, and improving the skills of community-based organization leaders.
Talikala, Inc. was founded on August 7, 1987 by three women of diverse backgrounds: American lay missionary Cindy O’Donnell, Filipina social worker Elizabeth O’Brien, and former night club dancer Felicidad Prieto. <br>
Originally, the group was formed to help protect the prostituted women and children in Davao City from the crisis wreaked by HIV/AIDS, <br>
but it has since grown able to respond to the challenge of totally emancipating these exploited women and children from the bondage of human trafficking and prostitution. <br>
